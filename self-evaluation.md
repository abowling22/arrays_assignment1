# Self assesment
- How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
I feel somewhat confident about Arrays, im sure itll get significantly more complex when we are moving variables around with different code commands. I understand the concept of moving different variables around to get a desired output.

- What questions do you have about Arrays?
Mostly how does manipulating the data get expressed in terms of code, and what does that actually look like in both the terminal and from the users perspective.
